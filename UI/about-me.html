<p class = "intro1 text-focus-in">Welcome!<br>
    I have a degree in computer science and I have dabbled into various aspects of it; network analysis, web design, teaching, software
    engineering and presently, I have an interest in AI research(what more can be found) and how it can be thoroughly applied on how
    to make machines think like humans just by learning.<br>
    I listen to music all the time, music makes me find solace, I excessively love reading and writing and some of my friends call me a movie encyclopedia.<br> Ha. :)<br><br>

    <!-- <b>My views:</b> <br>
    Many believe AI would not go far as we imagine, since we are already applying the algorithms, 
    the concept and the functionalities in our applications already, what else can it do or bring out in a gigantic way,
    will robots finally learn to code and code? even by doing considerable research. 
    Some feel it poses a threat either to human value or human lives.
    Some believe a thorough and well-fulfilling career can not be gotten out of it, 
    that it is mainly an interest pursued. 
    <br>
    Well, no.
    Those are the ignorant conceptions shared about a budding technology that is bound to change millions of lives. If/when the 
    area of machine learning is powerfully explored, bigger machines can come in the form of learning explicitly without human input.
    Won't it be fascinating for the future of all things or does it pose a survival threat?
