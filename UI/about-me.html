    I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer science from a private instituition 
    in Nigeria - <a class="find" target="_blank" href="https://bowen.edu.ng">
    Bowen University</a>&nbsp;and

    web design, teaching and I am currently gathering A.I/M.L skills.<br>
    <br>
    Presently, I am a freelance software developer - self-taught and also trained.<br>
    I am really interested in how tech fits into the future of things, and I prefer <br>
    to be in the long run by creating more efficient platforms to aid humanity.<br>
    I also love collaboration in software development more than anything else.
    <br><br>
    I am so passionate about advocacy and giving back to the society and I can call <br>
    myself a humanitarian and mental health enthusiast.
